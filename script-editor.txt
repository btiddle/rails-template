Oh, okay! It's just a one liner, after all. Honestly, anyone can do this one.

Just open Script Editor (it might be in Applications > Utilities, or in Applications > Applescript).

When the program opens, type 'choose color' (without the quotation marks) into the window, as shown above.

Save As.. choose Application from the list, and you'll have an application that you can click to bring up the Mac OS X Color Picker at any time.

And that's all there is to it!
